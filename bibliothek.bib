  comment   = {One important aspect can be realized only with the incremental approach: you can support not just backward compatibility, but also forward compatibility. This means that by
knowing just the old version of the protocol, old versions of an application can partially
understand its future version. Of course, they cannot understand all of it—that would be
miraculous. But the old versions can understand the parts already present in the older version
of the file, while ignoring the new additions. For example, imagine a file representing a text
document that supports only black letters in its first version. In the new version you could add
support for various font colorings. If done in a forward-compatible way, the format remains
readable by the old version. It will ignore all the colors, but the result will remain useful, at
least for viewing. Viewer-like applications are acceptable. Only editor applications need to
care about this and warn users before making modifications to newer versions of their documents. Possibly all coloring will be lost if the document is modified in older versions of the
editor},

HTTP/2 enables a more efficient use of network resources and a reduced perception of latency by introducing header field compression and allowing multiple concurrent exchanges on the same connection. It also introduces unsolicited push of representations from servers to clients. This specification is an alternative to, but does not obsolete, the HTTP/1.1 message syntax. HTTP's existing semantics remain unchanged.},
